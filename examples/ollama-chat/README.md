## Description

This example demonstrates a Logseq DB graph extracting data from [an Ollama LLM](https://ollama.com/) that can then be used in Logseq. With the DB version, a Logseq graph defines an ontology through its tags and properties. While the [schema.org ontology](https://schema.org) is used, the example script can be configured to use any Logseq graph's ontology. To see a demo of this example, see [this video](https://www.loom.com/share/bd98db65474f4e828bd4db65d556159c).

## Setup

* Install dependencies for the script:
    * Install node.js >= 20 and yarn.
    * Run `yarn install` to install npm dependencies.
    * Install [babashka](https://github.com/babashka/babashka).
* Setup ollama:
    * [Install ollama](https://ollama.com/download).
    * Download and run the [llama 3.2 model](https://ollama.com/library/llama3.2) with the command: `ollama run llama3.2`. This command needs to be running while chatting.
* Import a new DB graph with the provided [schema db file](./schema/db.sqlite) and call the graph `schema`.
    * You can also build the schema db from scratch if you clone the logseq repository and follow the [scripts/ README](https://github.com/logseq/logseq/tree/feat/db/scripts#usage) instructions for setting up a script and then run the schema.org related script.

## Usage

The script `ollama_chat.mjs` queries the LLM to ask for [structured data](https://ollama.com/blog/structured-outputs) about a specific thing/object. To use the script, we need to specify the Logseq graph we're querying, Let's start by asking about the book 'Don Quixote':

```
$ node ollama_chat.mjs ./schema book don quixote
...
 :pages-and-blocks
 [{:page
   {:block/title "Don Quixote",
    :build/tags [:schema.class/Book],
    :build/keep-uuid? true,
    :build/properties
    {:user.property/importedAt 1740499711013,
     :schema.property/author
     #{[:build/page
        {:block/title "Miguel de Cervantes Sa침ez",
         :build/tags [:schema.class/Person],
         :build/properties
         {:user.property/importedAt 1740499711013,
          :schema.property/url
          "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miguel_de_Cervantes"}}]},
     :schema.property/datePublished
     [:build/page {:build/journal 16050124}]}}}]}
```

You can see that we get back the book's published date and the author's name and url. This data is exactly what we asked for per the script's configuration. Now with this data copied to your clipboard (on osx), let's import it into Logseq `schema` graph you've created. Run the command `Import EDN Data`, paste the data and Import. Your graph now has a Don Quixote `#Book` page with 2 properties, each which have property values that are pages!

Now that we have some info about the book, let's get more data about its author:

```
$ node ollama_chat.mjs ./schema person "Miguel de Cervantes Sa침ez"
...
 :pages-and-blocks
 [{:page
   {:block/title "Miguel de Cervantes Sa침ez",
    :build/tags [:schema.class/Person],
    :build/keep-uuid? true,
    :build/properties
    {:user.property/importedAt 1740501976762,
     :schema.property/birthDate
     [:build/page {:build/journal 15471129}],
     :schema.property/birthPlace
     #{[:build/page
        {:block/title "Alcal치, Spain",
         :build/tags [:schema.class/Place]}]},
     :schema.property/gender "Male"}}}]}
```

Import this data into your graph and see your existing page about Miguel update with his birth place, birthday and gender! Feel free to query for any book or person. Sometimes you need to make the same query more than once to get back useful results for all properties.

So far we have been querying [books](https://schema.org/Book) and [people](https://schema.org/Person) tags/types. We got back a number of specific properties because the script already comes preconfigured for those tags, as well as for [movies](https://schema.org/Movie) and [songs](https://schema.org/MusicRecording). The script can also be used to explore any of [schema.org's 900 tags](https://schema.org/docs/full.html). For example, let's learn about the Clojure [software](https://schema.org/SoftwareSourceCode):

```
$ node ollama_chat.mjs ./schema softwaresourcecode clojure -p author codeRepository
...
 :pages-and-blocks
 [{:page
   {:block/title "Clojure",
    :build/tags [:schema.class/SoftwareSourceCode],
    :build/keep-uuid? true,
    :build/properties
    {:user.property/importedAt 1741017730510,
     :schema.property/author
     #{[:build/page
        {:block/title "Rich Hickey",
         :build/tags [:schema.class/Person],
         :build/properties
         {:user.property/importedAt 1741017730511,
          :schema.property/url "http://www.clojure.org/about/"}}]
       [:build/page
        {:block/title " contributors",
         :build/tags [:schema.class/Person],
         :build/properties
         {:user.property/importedAt 1741017730511,
          :schema.property/url
          "https://github.com/clojure/clojure/blob/master/CREDITS.md"}}]},
     :schema.property/codeRepository
     "https://github.com/clojure/clojure.git",
     :schema.property/url "https://clojure.org/"}}}]}
```

To step back a bit, why does this script use the schema.org ontology? It's because it is a large ontology that has been used by the major search engines for over a decade. In addition to 900 tags, it provides 1400+ [properties](https://meta.schema.org/Property).org that are well designed for reuse. To quickly explore a variety of properties, use `-r`. For example, we can redo the Clojure query and ask for 5 random properties associated with it:

```
$ node ollama_chat.mjs ./schema softwaresourcecode clojure -p author -r 5
To recreate these random properties: -p learningResourceType encodingFormat accessibilitySummary abstract sdPublisher
...
 :pages-and-blocks
 [{:page
   {:block/title "Clojure",
    :build/tags [:schema.class/SoftwareSourceCode],
    :build/keep-uuid? true,
    :build/properties
    {:user.property/importedAt 1741017889361,
     :schema.property/author
     #{[:build/page
        {:block/title "Rich Hickey",
         :build/tags [:schema.class/Person],
         :build/properties
         {:user.property/importedAt 1741017889361,
          :schema.property/url "https://github.com/clojure"}}]},
     :schema.property/learningResourceType "programming language",
     :schema.property/encodingFormat "text/x-clojure",
     :schema.property/accessibilitySummary
     "Clojure is a modern, dynamic, and functional programming language designed to write concurrent and parallel code without compromising performance.",
     :schema.property/abstract
     "Clojure is a compiled, multi-paradigm language that runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). It's based on Lisp syntax and offers features like immutability, recursion, and macros for building domain-specific languages.",
     :schema.property/sdPublisher
     #{[:build/page
        {:block/title "Rich Hickey",
         :build/tags [:schema.class/Person],
         :build/properties
         {:user.property/importedAt 1741017889361,
          :schema.property/url "https://github.com/clojure"}}]},
     :schema.property/url "https://clojure.org/"}}}]}
```

## Configuring the script

The script is configured with the `user-config` var in [ollama_chat.cljs](./src/logseq/ollama_chat.cljs). Feel free to modify it to try out different schema.org tags and properties.

You could also configure the script to work with your graph's ontology. Doing so requires knowing the `:db/ident` of your graph's tags and properties. To get this data, run the dev command `Show page data` and look for the keyword next to `:db/ident`. NOTE: I have not tried this outside of the schema.org ontology and don't know how well ollama will respond to custom ontologies. I would think schema.org works better than most ontologies because of its widespread adoption and thus nontrivial representation in a LLM's training.
