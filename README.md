## Description
### For Logseq users

`nbb-logseq` provides [easy CLJS scripting on
Node.js](https://github.com/babashka/nbb) for Logseq. Since logseq is primarily
written with [ClojureScript](https://clojurescript.org/), this scripting
environment has capabilities that are not possible in any other environment. For
example, [see here](examples/#query.cljs) for a script that queries any logseq
graph.

### For Clojure users

`nbb-logseq` is a custom version of [nbb](https://github.com/babashka/nbb) that
bundles support for datascript, datascript-transit and a couple other cljs
libraries that are useful to logseq. A good amount of the datascript API is
available as [seen by its
tests](https://github.com/babashka/nbb-features/blob/main/test/features/datascript/test_runner.cljs).
Since nbb only loads features/libraries when they are required, users can write
datascript based CLIs without concern of loading the other libraries.

## Usage

Install `nbb-logseq` from npm:

`npm install @logseq/nbb-logseq -g`

Omit `-g` for a local install.

All the usage examples from https://github.com/babashka/nbb#usage apply to
`nbb-logseq` e.g.

```clojure
$ nbb-logseq -e '(+ 1 2 3)'
6
```

`nbb-logseq` provides `nbb` 0.4.0 with the additional libraries.
